## 2026-10-16 — User profile schema

- Added `users` with `tokenIdentifier`, theme preference, onboarding state, and `updatedAt`; indexed identity lookups with `by_tokenIdentifier`. Preserved the starter `numbers` table.
- Validation: Convex TypeScript check, schema ESLint check, and `git diff --check` passed. Full build blocked by the existing `src/router.tsx:33` unknown error type.
- Authentication wiring is a separate sprint. Deployment pending: this worktree has no configured Convex deployment or web hosting target.
